**Dominos Group Fade** is a WoW AddOn that fades Dominos bars in and out based on macro conditionals.

It was written for [Fenril](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/proudmoore/Fenril/), who posted [this request](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10670717174) on the official UI and Macro forum.

It's currently a work in progress, major parts may change between now and completion.

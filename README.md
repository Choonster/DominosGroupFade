**Dominos Group Fade** is a WoW AddOn that fades Dominos bars in and out based on macro conditionals.

It was written for [Fenril](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/proudmoore/Fenril/), who posted [this request](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10670717174) on the official UI and Macro forum.

It's currently a work in progress, major parts may change between now and completion.

To install from GitHub, click the **Download ZIP** button or [this link](https://github.com/Choonster/DominosGroupFade/archive/master.zip) and decompress the downloaded ZIP.
After decompressing the ZIP, copy and paste the files in the `DominosGroupFade-master` folder into the `WoW\Interface\AddOns\DominosGroupFade` folder (creating it if you're installing for the first time) and restart the WoW client.
